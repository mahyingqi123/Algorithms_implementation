# Algorithms_implementation
These repo contains the POC implementation of algorithms that I have learned
and demonstrates my ability in understanding and implementing the advanced algorithms.

Algorithms implemented:
1. Radix Sort
2. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
3. Dijkstra Algorithm
4. Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
5. Ukkonen's Algorithm with Suffix Tree
6. Dynamic Programming
7. Boyer Moore Algorithm
8. BWT, HUFFMAN, LZW, LZ77, LZ78 Compression Algorithms
9. KMP Algorithm
10. BTree algorithm
11. and more that I have forgotten... :D
